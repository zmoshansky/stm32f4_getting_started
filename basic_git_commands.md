CYPTOGRAPHY

Public private key: put someone else’s lock on something to send to them (public key) and then they can unlock it once it is sent to them 
System security only relies on your key being kept private (secret)

Hash function: 
• Reduce a set in size—things will map to the same hash function 
• One way function

Then run back through private key and will get back the initial sent value

Confidentiality: no one can encrypt, Integrity: same thing, Authenticity: sent by the right person

Ssh keys: terminal sent over the internet 
ECE: username@server_name 
Command: $ ssh –P 1234user_name@ssh.ece.ubc.ca

Scp secure copy files:

.ssh – anything with a dot infront of it is secure 
Ls –a – include every thing (hidden directories) 
- Single dash one letter –- double dash is a word

drwx: directory read write execute

git clone : not branching but copying 
git pull –all : to get all the code 
git fetch –all : everything that has been changed, lists of all branches from master

git log : shows all changes (history) 
git branch lists branches

git checkout –b [name] (new branch)

switch between braches use git checkout
git checkout master HEAD : ( most recent version) 
git status : tell you what branch your on and what has been affected 
git diff : shows the delta from last time 
git add [file_name/branch] : it will pop up things that have changed 
git commit –m “what did I do—explain in this message” 
git push origin HEAD – pushing up onto remote server of github 
• Origin – wherever you are sending it to 
• HEAD – what reference –your most recent file 
If you were trying to delete a file called LICENSE, but then chose to change that and did not want to have it updated with master

$ git checkout –LICENSCE

To delete a branch 
$ git branch –D [name_of_branch]
